I’m a product driven, full stack software engineer from Toronto. I’m passionate about creating world class user experiences that raise the bar on usability, accessiblity and most importantly, happiness.

I thrive in innovative, fast paced environments and love to work with creative, driven individuals. Programming is not my only focus, I’m interested in fintech, design, product management and much more. I love learning and am always teaching myself something new.

You can find my projects on [Github](https://www.github.com/smehtaca), or connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smehtaca) or [email](mailto:sameer@smehta.ca).
